# Signup-Login_Form
 In an ASP.NET Core MVC app, user login and registration are handled with ASP.NET Core Identity. Users register with a form, and their credentials are securely stored. For login, SignInManager authenticates users, creating an authentication cookie. Access is controlled using Authorize with roles or policies for authorization.
